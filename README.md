# Tic Tac Toe game

This is an interactive Tic Tac Toe game implemented in React. 
The human player always makes the first move, and the computer never lose. 


## How to run this game

1. Clone this repo
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/signalcat/TicTacToe.git
 ```
2. Run 'npm install' and 'npm start' in the root directory 
  ```
  cd TicTacToe
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
3. A browser should appear automatically and display the game board 

## Things to improve
* In the current implementation, computer plays as 'O' and human plays as 'X'. It would be more flexible to allow each player to choose their marks.
